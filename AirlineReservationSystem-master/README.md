# AirlineReservationSystem
A Java (JSP) based online reservation system for Airlines!
This programming project involves developing a Airline Reservation System for use by
travel professionals (i.e. not passengers). It is a Java-based GUI application that
interfaces with a backend MySQL database to manage its data. The GUI is browser based (JSP)
The database schema is based on Figure 3.8 (page 82) in the textbook. A
description of the high-level functionality can be found in Exercise 3.12 (page 81). An
ER diagram can be found in Figure 7.20 (page 236), which provides a conceptual model.

It includes Eclipse Project source code and requirements!
